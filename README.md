# placeholder-title-client

This repo serves as the client-side for our social-network project. It runs on react, and currently we are making the decision of using React state management, Redux, or MobX. Other than that it it relies on SCSS for styling, and is open for contributions :D.

Happy Hacking!! ðŸš€
